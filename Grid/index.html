                <p>Grid Core is designed to see what happens when you try new ideas without being afraid to break things. It's built on top of the amazing Godot Engine which we love. just exploring what else is possible with a fast starting point rather than spending precious time and losing hair trying to make our own</p>

            <div class="Uhh...">
                <h2>Why Another Game Engine?</h2>
                <p>We made this because sometimes the best tool is the one that works exactly how <em>you</em> need it to. Grid is our playground for testing cleaner workflows, better UX, and tools that actually make sense when that light in your head is turned on.</p>

                <p>This project exists because some problems deserve solutions tailored for actual developers, not hypotheticals. Grid experiments with cleaner editing, improved usability, stronger tooling, and a more flexible foundation for the things we're building at Fade Crew.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="hmm">
                <h2>The Foundation</h2>
                <p>If you stumbled here by accident, cool. If you're a fan of what Godot has done for the game dev community, same here. Grid only exists because they built something worth extending.</p>

                <p>If you love Godot (deadass why wouldn't you?), even better. Grid wouldn't exist without the incredible work put into it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ahh">
                <h2>Something Massive</h2>
                <p>Fade Crew builds practical computer things and experiences like Modern Football, and Grid is one piece of that bigger mission. Use it, study it, fork it, ignore it. Whatever you do, hope it helps you in some small way.</p>

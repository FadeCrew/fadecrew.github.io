                <h2>The Vision</h2>
                <p>A football experience that pushes far past the usual boundaries of the genre. Built to feel authentic, tactical, and alive in ways traditional football games don't even attempt.</p>

                <p>Modern Football is where we're testing what happens when you rebuild a sports game from scratch with no legacy baggage. Deep simulation, smarter AI, and gameplay that respects the sport instead of just copying what came before.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="philosophy">
                <h2>Built Different</h2>
                <p>Most football games are iterations. They're built on decades of assumptions about what a football game should be. We're asking: what if we started fresh?</p>

                <p>What if the AI actually understood tactics? What if player behavior felt less scripted and more human? What if the game reacted to your decisions in ways that actually mattered?</p>

                <p>Those are the questions we're trying to answer. No fluff, no gimmicks—just football that feels right.</p>

            <div class="status">
                <h2>Current Status</h2>
                <p>We're deep in development, experimenting with core systems and pushing the simulation further than we initially planned. It's taking time because we're not interested in shipping something half-baked.</p>

                <p>When there's something worth showing, you'll see it here first.</p>

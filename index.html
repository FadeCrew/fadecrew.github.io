        <section class="about">
            <p>Fade Crew develops tools that simplify real work—from game engines to general-purpose utilities. We ship a mix of free and paid projects built to solve problems without fluff.</p>
            <p>We're also the team behind <strong>Modern Football</strong>, a football experience that pushes far past the usual boundaries of the genre.</p>

            <h2>Grid ⚡</h2>
            <div class="project-content">
                <p>Grid is basically Godot, but we've tweaked it (a lot) to see what happens when you try new ideas without being afraid to break things. It's built on top of the amazing Godot Engine—we're not trying to replace it, just exploring what else is possible.</p>

                <p>We made this because sometimes the best tool is the one that works exactly how <em>you</em> need it to. Grid is our playground for testing cleaner workflows, better UX, and tools that actually make sense when you're deep in a project at 2am.</p>

                <p>If you stumbled here by accident, cool. If you love Godot (we do too), even better. Grid wouldn't exist without their incredible work—it stands on the shoulders of what they built for the game dev community.</p>

                <p>Fade Crew makes practical tools and original games like Modern Football, and Grid is one piece of that bigger mission. Use it, fork it, learn from it, or ignore it completely. Whatever helps you ship. 🚀</p>

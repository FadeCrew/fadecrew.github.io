                <p>Grid is basically Godot, but we've tweaked it (a lot) to see what happens when you try new ideas without being afraid to break things. It's built on top of the amazing Godot Engine—we're not trying to replace it, just exploring what else is possible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="why">
                <h2>Why Grid Exists</h2>
                <p>We made this because sometimes the best tool is the one that works exactly how <em>you</em> need it to. Grid is our playground for testing cleaner workflows, better UX, and tools that actually make sense when you're deep in a project at 2am.</p>

                <p>This project exists because some problems deserve solutions tailored for actual developers, not hypotheticals. Grid experiments with cleaner editing, improved usability, stronger tooling, and a more flexible foundation for the things we're building at Fade Crew.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="respect">
                <h2>Standing on Shoulders</h2>
                <p>If you stumbled here by accident, cool. If you're a fan of what Godot has done for the game dev community, same here. Grid only exists because they built something worth extending.</p>

                <p>If you love Godot (we do too), even better. Grid wouldn't exist without their incredible work—it stands on the shoulders of what they built for the game dev community.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mission">
                <h2>Part of Something Bigger</h2>
                <p>Fade Crew builds practical tools and original games like Modern Football, and Grid is one piece of that bigger mission. Use it, study it, fork it, ignore it. Whatever you do, hope it helps you in some small way. 🚀</p>
